        <h1> Lessons From Keith Rabois Essay 1: How to become a Venture Capitalist</h1>
        <p> </p>
        <p> Over the next few weeks I will be publishing an essay each Monday, covering a variety of different topics that I’ve learned about from working with Keith Rabois. They will focus on investing, management, operations, and hiring. The essays will build upon one another. </p>
        <p> Venture can be difficult to break into; it’s based on decentralized trust. Partners spend little time together as they’re primarily out and about with founders, and so, unlike a startup, where you are crammed into a small office and know exactly what everyone is working on, venture by default requires far more alignment and trust. Last week Keith had 8 board meetings, meaning he spent probably 8x more time with founders than with his partners. </p>
        <p> That trust has a very broad scope, from how to allocate resources, to helping founders with future financings, to operational advice and feedback on candidates. Keith needs to be able to trust that the advice I provide to a founder is valid, since he may not see that founder until long after the advice has been implemented. </p>
        <p> If venture is your ultimate destination, then your career path should optimize towards building reputation and trust with venture capitalists, across all of the topics above. Fundamentally, in order to get a job in venture a current VC needs to think you will be a good VC. They need to think you have relevant expertise and they need to think you have great judgment. There are no shortcuts to developing expertise or judgement. The path I propose requires a long time horizon, but I believe it sets you up very well for success in the industry. Below, I’ll take a hypothetical Jill Johnson, a recent university graduate, through a representative path. </p>
        <p> I hope this advice applies to a wide audience, but do recognize that it comes painted with my own biases and privileges of being white, technical, male, and having attended MIT. </p>
        <h3> Step 1: Become a junior generalist (2-3 years) </h3>
        <p> The first step in this path is to start getting experience so that you can join a high-upside early stage startup. To be appealing to one of these startups you need to: </p>
        <ul>
          <li> Learn the basics of sales, marketing, operations, and how to communicate your ideas in the professional world </li>
          <li> Identify a promising early stage startup </li>
          <li> Learn the basics of strategy and get in tune with tech news </li>
        </ul>
        <p></p>
        <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Specialists are great, and it&#39;s natural to want to hire them, especially in areas new to you<br><br>But often, an A+ generalist can pick it all up in 90 days anyways<br><br>Most of the time, that&#39;s a better call</p>&mdash; Jason ✨𝕊𝕒𝕒𝕊𝕥𝕣 𝔸𝕟𝕟𝕦𝕒𝕝✨ Lemkin 🦄 (@jasonlk) <a href="https://twitter.com/jasonlk/status/1087885996727754752?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 23, 2019</a></blockquote>

        <p> As Jason Lemkin points out, a generalist is incredibly valuable at a startup. For most speciality roles, like sales or communitications, a strong generalist can pick up enough to be effective in 90 days. This is important: startups are constantly changing, and the specialists it needs are constantly changing, too. </p>
        <p> At one of our highest growth portfolio companies, we have this incredible problem-solver, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/olivia-chen-22b38960/"> Olivia</a>, ex-Bain consultant, who inevitably moves to a new role every 3 months. You always know at board meetings when the CEO brings up a new major business issue, that the following sentence is, “but don’t worry, Olivia is on the job” </p>
        <p> One of the ways to become a generalist is to join a consulting firm as an associate. You will see problems across different industries, which will help you identify the patterns across them, and you pick up a variety of different skill sets by helping solve them. The most important skill you learn is how to communicate and present to executives, or what is also called “executive presence”. </p>
        <p> Don’t stay too long in this role. You need skin in the game as soon as possible. Keith actually has a rule where he won’t hire anyone who stuck with consulting for more than 2 years. Jeff and Max are good examples that he convinced to leave consulting. Consulting is not the only way to become a junior generalist, however it’s one of the most accessible paths to someone fresh out of college. If you’re more technically-minded you can hack on side projects and present them at hackathons. </p>
        <p> <i> Jill goes to the on-campus interviews at USC, gets her offer from McKinsey and dives right in. On her nights and weekends she follows tech journalists, CEOs, and VCs on Twitter. She goes to events where they are speaking. She reads about the startups that are launching on TechCrunch. She scours the breakout list (<a href="https://breakoutlist.com/" target="_blank">link</a>). A couple startups catch her eye. She reads Stratechery (<a href="https://stratechery.com/" target="_blank">link</a>), so she can translate the business news she sees on Twitter into strategic frameworks. </i> </p>
